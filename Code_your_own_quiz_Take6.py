A computer is a ___(1)___. Unlike a toaster or a refrigerator, you can write any kind of ___(2)___ --a precise
sequence of instructions--for a ___(1)___, and it can execute it. In fact, with only four things (simple arithmetic,
operators, if statements, and functions), you can in theory write any ___(2)___. In practice, this simplicity
requires a precise grammar that determines how code must be written and the order in which code is evaluated.
For example, in ___(3)___, as in many computer languages, variables are assigned using this form: NAME = EXPRESSION.
And ___(3)___, like any language using a Backus-Naur form of notation, always evaluates the ___(4)___ side
of an assignment statement first.''',
'''
To create a ___(1)___, use an assignment statement with expressions and operators to identify the ___(1)___â€™s value.
Use ___(1)___s to make code readable and reduce the amount of code you have to write; a number without a ___(1)___ is
a ___(2)___. Avoid them because ___(2)___s make code harder to read, harder to generalize, and prone to errors.

Like ___(1)___s, ___(3)___s are reusable and reduce the amount of code you have to write. Unlike a ___(1)___, a ___(3)___
can perform an action. In Python, ___(1)___s assigned inside a ___(3)___ are ___(4)___ while ___(1)___s assigned outside
of a ___(3)___ are global.''',
'''
A ___(1)___ is a type of structured ___(2)___ that can combine multiple ___(2)___ types (integers and strings, for example).
It's also a ___(3)___ object, which means it can be modified. In addition, ___(1)___s support ___(4)___--multiple variables
can be assigned to the same ___(1)___.''']
